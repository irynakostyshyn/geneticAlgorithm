## Parallel Genetic Algorithm Library


**Description**

This is a simple implementation of the genetic algorithm.
It is created to find 'the optimal solution' (maximum of a function).

The main class that users use is GeneticAlgorithm.
Despite this, there is an implementation of classes Individual and Population.
